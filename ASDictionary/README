About ASDictionary
==================

ASDictionary exports scriptable Mac applications' dictionaries in HTML format. 
Requires Mac OS X 10.12 or later.

Exporting application dictionaries
----------------------------------

1. Use the 'Dictionary' menu to select one or more scriptable applications, 
   or drag-and-drop one or more application files onto ASDictionary's 
   application icon or Export window.

2. Select one or both file formats: single-file HTML and/or frame-based HTML. 
   Check the 'Compact classes' option to combine duplicate classes into one. 
   (For example, TextEdit defines a 'document' class in its Standard Suite, 
   and again in its TextEdit Suite.) Check the 'Show invisibles' option to 
   include hidden classes and commands in HTML output.

3. Select one or more terminology styles.

4. Click 'Export', and select a destination folder for the generated files.


Notes
-----

- Caution: ASDictionary will overwrite any existing files when exporting 
  dictionaries.

- Exporting larger dictionaries may take several seconds; GUI responsiveness 
  may be limited during this time.

- The appscript bridges for Python and Ruby depend on ASDictionary to support 
  their built-in help systems. You can specify text wrapping options for help 
  system output in ASDictionary's Preferences window.
