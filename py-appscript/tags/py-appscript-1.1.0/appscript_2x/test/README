Some of the code in these tests may not be 100% portable (hardcoded paths, etc) so may fail for some users, although they have been passed on G4 and i386 hardware running OS X 10.4.x + Python 2.5.

Note that some mactypes unit tests may fail as Alias and File comparisons are rather dumb and don't normalise path strings before comparing/hashing.
